        <!-- The core message -->
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            I'm writing this because I can't bear the thought of our last conversation being our last. The silence has been deafening, and I'm so incredibly sorry for the way I acted. I know it was harsh, and I want to explain, not to excuse it, but to give you the full picture.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            That day was one of the worst I've had in a long time. Between late-night lectures, a stressful meeting, and the alcohol I drank to cope, I was completely overwhelmed. It's no excuse for my behavior, and I deeply regret that I let my stress get in the way of treating you with the kindness you deserve.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            My friend told me to clear the air because I was confused with our mixed conversation in texts, that's why I asked about a relationship.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            I don't need a relationship, and I will not bug you. We can keep what we had a secret if you want, and I am open to discussing any terms. I can also start smoking with you sometimes. I can do my first puff with you.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            I'm open to anything you want, and we can discuss any terms you'd like. If you ever feel we are getting too attached, you can walk away at any time. This website will delete itself in 2 days.
        </p>
